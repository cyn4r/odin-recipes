     <h2>Original recipe of Chocotorta</h2>
     <p>A regular at most Argentinian celebrations and birthday parties, chocotorta is a simple no-bake dessert that can be prepared by even the most unskilled cook, yet so delicious as if made by a professional. According to the original recipe, chocotorta consists of layers of Chocolinas chocolate cookies dipped in port wine, with a mixture of dulce de leche and cream cheese (queso crema) in between. However, today, chocolate cookies are more commonly dipped in coffee. The cake is traditionally rectangular, but other shapes can be made as well. </p>
     <h3>Ingredients</h3>
     <ul>
         <li>600g Dulce de Leche</li>
         <li>600g Cream Cheese</li>
         <li>750g Chocolate Biscuit</li>
         <li>250ml Coffee</li>
         <li>40ml Cream</li>
         <li>80g Dark Chocolate</li>
         <li>20g Butter</li>
     </ul>
     <h4>Steps</h4>
     <ol>
         <li>Mix the dulce de leche and cream cheese with a mixer set on low speed for two minutes — preferably, leave the cream cheese at room temperature for at least 15 minutes before mixing, so it's easier to mix.</li>
         <li>Line a deep 20X20cm baking pan (the bottom and the sides) with parchment paper, leaving enough to overhang, for easier unmolding.</li>
         <li>Start assembling the cake. Dip each cookie shortly in coffee, then place each on the pan's bottom, creating a cookie layer, and then spread it with a thin layer of dulce de leche and cream cheese mixture.</li>
         <li>Repeat this step five more times — you should end up with 6 cookie layers and five layers of dulce de leche and cream cheese mixture.</li>
         <li>Refrigerate for a minimum of six hours.</li>
         <li>Once ready to serve, take out of the refrigerator, place a large tray on the top of the pan, and flip to invert the cake onto the said tray. Remove the parchment paper.</li>
         <li>For decorating the cake, make a 300g mixture of dulce de leche and cream cheese, then spread the top of the cake thinly with the said mixture. Save some of the mixture of decorating later.</li>
         <li>Prepare the ganache by melting chocolate, heavy cream, and butter in a bain-marie.</li>
         <li>Wait until the ganache comes to room temperature, then place it in a piping bag, and pipe the ganache along the edges of the cake to create a dripping effect.</li>
         <li>Place the remaining dulce de leche and cream cheese mixture into a piping bag, and pipe swirls along the cake's edges.</li>
         <li>Finally, fill the center of the cake with chocolate shavings.</li>
         <li>Refrigerate for minimum of six hours before serving.</li>
